            <h2> Business trips in Amsterdam </h2>
            <p>When we were in Amsterdam, we visited two companies - Endeavour and CleverFranke. 
                These companies were quite different, in my opinion. 
                CleverFranke heavily relies on data and explores various ways to present it, 
                while Endeavour focuses on design without data. 
                However, one thing that they had in common was that they did not use sustainability in their websites.
                 The person we talked to at Endeavour was not even aware of how it could be used. CleverFranke mentioned that they had considered it, 
                 but both companies said that they would not use it if their clients did not request it. 
                 So, the question is: would you rather avoid using sustainable design and be indifferent, 
                 or encourage everyone to use sustainable design, but potentially lose customers? This was the scenario presented by both companies. 
                 It seems that Denmark is quite advanced in terms of sustainable design, but it may not have reached beyond the Danish borders yet.</p>
